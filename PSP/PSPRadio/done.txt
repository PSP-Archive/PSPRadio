-Added support for comments. Use ';' as the first character. (Blank lines are also ignored)
-Now urls with no path work (http://64.202.98.193:8000 didn't work, but http://64.202.98.193:8000/ did. Now both do).
-Now asking the server to send metadata.
-Metadata information is displayed for the current stream.



Things to try:
http://64.202.98.193:8000 (club 977 80s channel, 24kbps, 16khz mono)
