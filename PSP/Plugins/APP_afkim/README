--1b
Fixed account creation to actually create the correct account types (gtalk and yahoo were creating msn accounts!)
  Thanks to Lordsturm and pspfan on the pspupdates forums for noticing this one!
It seems that the crashfix for too many buddies doesn't work always (or maybe something else is causing a crash), if you have one then record the UPC and RA hex values (thats the top most and the bottom right ones) and drop me a message with them telling me what you were doing.

--1a
Fix the crash bug from having too many friends - This is only a cheap fix to stop it crashing, you will have trouble selecting buddies that are off the screen, a proper fix will come next version.
It should also fix the new message bug (people who send messages weren't highlighted correctly)
And the server chat window now shows the bitlbee status so you can see why your accounts won't connect. 
Increased the size of the input boxes when creating accounts to 40 chars.

####################### Usage #######################
Getting started guide:
http://localhost.geek.nz/afkim/docs/gettingstarted.html

Upgrading:
 - copy your 'bitlbee.cfg' file from your old afkim folder to the new one, done!

You can change which keyboard you are using by editing the afkim.cfg file in the afkim folder.
  If you are using the p-sprint keyboard then enter is [start] and to get from the chat window to the contact list is L-shoulder.

####################### FAQ #########################

Q: When will you add IR keyboard support?
A: When I get an IR keyboard, I'm having trouble finding one for a good price.

Q: Whats all this spam in the console now?
A: That would be the message from the bitlbee server, most of these should be hidden, but I haven't done it yet ;)

Q: What is an ICQ username?
A: It is your ICQ number.

Q: It crashed! / I'm stuck!
A: uh thanks. a non-question :P I need more details than this, alot more. tell me exactly what you were doing and I might just be able to help.

Q: It crashed when connecting to wifi or just after.
A: You probably have a real bad wifi signal, move closer and try again.

Q: How do I sign in?
A: AFKIM automatically signs into all the accounts it knows of.

Q: How do I know if I'm online?
A: If the icon for the account is colored you are online, if it is grey or not there you are offline or connecting.

Q: What is that lightbulb icon, I added a gtalk account!
A: That lightbulb is the jabber logo, gtalk uses jabber so it gets the jabber icon.

Q: This isn't a universal messenger, I can't add my Jabber or *Insert obscure messaging program here* accounts!@!
A: Jabber will come in the future, its basically in there already, if you know about bitlbee you should be able to add it ;)
   Other protocols can't be added, we rely on bitlbee for the transports.

Q: How do these nicknames get decided? Can I rename my contacts!?
A: The bitlbee server decides how to name your contacts, usually it bases them of their username. You can rename buddies in the buddy menu.

Q: Can I use a different bitlbee server or add an existing account?
A: Yes, you need to create a bitlbee.cfg file in the afkim folder, its format is as follows:
---------------------------
SERVER
USERNAME
PASSWORD
---------------------------
We always connect on port 6667, don't try change it in the server string ;)
If you do this, you should also set the following settings:
set auto_connect false
set auto_reconnect true
set display_namechanges true
set auto_reconnect_delay 60
