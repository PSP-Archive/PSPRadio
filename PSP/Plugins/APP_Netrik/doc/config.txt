  configuration file
>====================<

[This file explains how netrik can be customized. See index.txt or index.html
for an overview of available netrik documentation.]

You can set various options influencing netrik's behaviour as default in the
configuration file. Just create/edit ~/.netrikrc for that.

The format of the file is very simple: You can store exactly the same options
there which are also allowed as command line arguments. (These are listed
in options.*</a>) Each one has to appear on a single line. (No blank lines
are allowed, and the last one has to be ended with a newline.)

You can also set a file name or an URL, simply inserting it on a line without
any options. This URL will serve as a home page: When netrik is called without
other non-option arguments, this page is loaded; otherwise the one given on
the command line.
