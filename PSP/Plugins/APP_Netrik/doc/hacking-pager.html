[This file contains a description of the viewer module. See hacking.txt or
<a href="hacking.html">hacking.html</a> for an overview of the manual.]
</p>

<h2>Pager Operation</h2>

<p>
As the pager doesn't just follow a static algorithm, but has to react to
certain events (keyboard input), the structure is somewhat harder to retrace.
</p>

<p>
The central pager function is <a href="#display">display()</a>,
which contains the main loop (keyboard dispatcher) which performs some
action(s) on each keypress, as well as the interface to main().
</p>

<p>
These actions directly performed by the keyboard commands mostly do not have a
direct visible effect; instead, they alter the pager state, which becomes
visible with the next screen update -- this is performed in each main loop
iteration before waiting for the next keypress. Some actions also require
temporarily exiting the pager and returning to main(), which is fairly easy and
transparent, as the pager state is stored directly in the
<a href="hacking-page.html#pageStruct">page structure</a> and the
screen contents thus can be easily restored when reentering the pager.
</p>

<p>
The pager state consists of three basic components: "pager_pos" is the line
number (in page) of the first line visible on the screen. "active_link"
contains the link number of the currently selected link. (Or -1 if none.)
"cursor_x" and "cursor_y" tell where the cursor is on the page. (Not the
screen!) The additional "sticky_cursor" flag allows keeping the cursor in its
place while scrolling (if possible), instead of moving it to the screen top.
</p>

<p>
Each of the major parameters is manipulated chiefly by one function:
<a href="#scrollTo">scroll_to()</a> sets "pager_pos",
<a href="#activateLink">activate_link()</a> sets "active_link",
and <a href="#setCursor">set_cursor()</a> sets the cursor position
(and also manages the "sticky_cursor" status). The variables aren't
independent, however -- scroll_to() may need to deactivate the active link if
it moved off the screen, and often move the cursor; activate_link may need to
scroll if the link is presently not an the screen, and always has to set the
cursor position; set_cursor() has to deactivate any previously active link, and
also scroll if the desired cursor position is outside the current screen. This
interrelation requires the functions calling each other in a quite complicated
manner, sometimes even recursively... Maybe we should try to write a generic
function for updating all the states at once by a single request.
</p>

<p>
Note that scroll_to() and activate_link() do not only set the state, but also
(re)render the visible page part (using
<a href="hacking-layout.html#render">render()</a>, which is
described in hacking-layout.*). Probably it would be better to do this in the
main loop also. Moreover, activate_link() even modifies the page, which was a
very bad idea and surely will be changed in the future.
</p>

<a name="display" id="display">

<h2>display()</h2>

<p>
The viewer basically consists of a keyboard dispatcher that loops until some
command was given that requires some action by main(). These include the quit
command, link following, history commands, entering the command prompt, or text
search.
</p>

<p>
display() tells main() what action is required, by the return value which is an
"enum Pager_ret".
</p>

<p>
After main() has done it's work, display() will be called again; it will then
continue just where it stopped, which is possible because the important pager
state information (postion of the currently visible page part, cursor position,
currently selected link) are stored in the
<a href="hacking-page.html#pageStruct">page structure</a>, which is
described under <a href="hacking-page.html#pageList">Page List
Handling</a> in hacking-page.*. Thus the way over main() is quite
seemless; to the user it usually looks as if he was in the pager all the time.
</p>

<p>
To allow for this, display() needs to do some work to restore the state upon
startup.
</p>

<p>
First, the page is scrolled to the previous position, using
<a href="#scrollTo">scroll_to()</a>. "old_line" is set to
PAGE_INVALID (meaning the pager presently displays nothing) before scrolling,
so that the screen contents always will be drawn completely anew.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, the cursor position is set to the saved one using
<a href="#setCursor">set_cursor()</a>. Note that the position
has to be stored before scroll_to(), as this function might move it out of the
screen and adjust the cursor, in case a new cursor position was requested. (By
a text search.)
</p>

<p>
Finally, if there is a selected link, it is (re)activated with
<a href="hacking-links.html#activateLink">activate_link()</a>
(described in hacking-links.*). The active link also has to be saved before
scroll_to(), as the link position may have changed in the meantime, causing
scroll_to() to deactivate the previouly selected link if it is no longer on the
screen.
</p>

<p>
Reactivating the link is omitted when the pager is restarted after a text
search command ("search.type" is set) -- in this case the cursor position has
higher priority and is not to be overwritten.
</p>

<p>
Initialization is slightly different if an anchor was activated, which is
indicated by "page->active_anchor" being set. In this case, instead of callig
scroll_to() directly,
<a href="hacking-links.html#activateAnchor">activate_anchor()</a>
(also described in hacking-links.*) is used. This one also scrolls (but to the
anchor position, not the previous pager position), and additionally draws the
anchor marks.
</p>

<p>
After completing these initalizations, the keyboard input loop is entered,
which reads one character in each iteration (note that the mvgetch() fuction
used for that also updates the curses screen), and then dispatches to the
requested command in a big switch.
</p>

<p>
The cursor position (passed to mvgetch()) is determined from
"page->cursor_[xy]", which are page coordinates, and have to be transformed to
screen coordinates first.
</p>

</a>    <!-- display -->

<h2>Scrolling Commands</h2>

<p>
The scrolling commands are all implemented by simple calls to scroll_to() with
different parameters. All relative movement commands can simply add or subtract
a constant number of lines to move, as scroll_to() checks for the page
boundaries.
</p>

<a name="scrollTo" id="scrollTo">

<h3>scroll_to()</h3>

<p>
This function scrolls the visible page area to the desired position. It moves
(or deletes) the screen content, and repaints newly visible areas using
<a href="hacking-layout.html#render">render()</a> (see
hacking-layout.*).
</p>

<p>
It is called with the desired new position as argument. This position is
described by the line number, of that line of the output page which is
displayed in the first screen line.
</p>

<p>
First the desired new position is checked to be in the valid range.
</p>

<p>
If it is greater than the page length minus one screenwidth, it is set to that
value. (The last page line can't move above the bottom screen line this way.)
</p>

<p>
If smaller then zero, it is set to zero. (The page top can't move below the
screen top.) Note that this will undo the above check, if the output page is
smaller than one screenfull -- in this case, the page end is always above the
screen end.
</p>

<p>
Now that we know the real destination position, the difference to the present
position (stored in the static "old_line") is calculated.
</p>

<p>
If the absolute value of that difference is not more than a screenfull,
scrolling is used. This is done by the insdelln() curses function, called with
the cursor being in the first screen line. (Called with a negative value it
deletes lines, causing the screen contents to scroll up; called with a positive
argument, it inserts lines, causing the screen contents to scroll down.)
</p>

<p>
After scrolling, the new lines revealed at the top or bottom of the screen need
to be rendered. After scrolling down (negative "scroll_lines"), the first
"scroll_lines" of the screen have to be repainted. This is done by calling
render() with "scroll_lines" as the height, 0 as the screen position (the first
lines of the screen are repainted), and "new_line" as page position.
("new_line" contains the page position of the first screen line.)
</p>

<p>
After scrolling up, the last screen lines have to be repainted. This is done
similar. The hight is "-scroll_lines" ("scroll_lines" is negative when
scrolling up), the screen position is the screen end minus "-sroll_lines", and
the page position is the page position of the first screen line ("new_line")
plus the screen position of the rendered area.
</p>

<p>
If the difference is too big for scrolling, the whole screen is erased and
repainted.
</p>

<p>
The first time this function is called, "old_line" has the value PAGE_INVALID
(defined as the biggest possible positive int value), indicating that the
screen contains nothing valid yet. There is no special handling necessary for
this case -- "scroll_lines" gets a very big value, and thus the whole screen is
always repainted.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the cursor position is updated, if necessary. If the cursor is no
longer on the screen (more exactly, inside the active screen area), it is set
to the home position with <a href="#setCursor">set_cursor()</a>.
If the "sticky_cursor" flag is not set, the cursor is always homed.
</p>

</a>    <!-- scrollTo -->

<h2>Cursor Movement Commands</h2>

<p>
Just like the scrolling commands, the cursor movement commands are all
implemented by single calls to a specific function (set_cursor()) with the
desired new position, which is calculated from the current one.
</p>

<a name="setCursor" id="setCursor">

<h3>set_cursor()</h3>

<p>
set_cursor() is responsible for setting the cursor to some desired page
position (not screen position!). It also sets the "sticky_cursor" flag, so that
the cursor will stay in it's place (again, page position) until reset.
</p>

<p>
If called with -1 as x and y position, the "sticky_cursor" flag is cleared instead,
and the cursor set to the home position -- which is column 0 in the first line
inside the active screen area.
</p>

<p>
If the requested new position is outside the present active screen area, the
page first needs to be scrolled. If the position is before the active screen
area, we scroll as many lines back as the position is outside; if it is behind
the active area, we scroll as many lines forward.
</p>

<p>
Now we test whether the requested position is on the screen, and truncate if
not. The y position is actually tested against the page boundaries (after
scrolling, those should be equal in case the requested position is outside);
only the x position is tested against the screen boundaries, as there is
presently no x scrolling.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we test whether there is some link at the new cursor position. If
there is one, and it wasn't already active, we activate it now. (Using
<a href="hacking-links.html#activateLink">activate_link()</a>,
see hacking-links.*.) If there was a link active up to now, but there is no
link at the new position, the old one is deactivated. (activate_link() does
this automatically, as -1 will be passed as the link number in this situation.)
</p>

<p>
Only now the cursor is set to the new position, and the sticky status set. (Or
reset, if homing.)
</p>

</a>    <!-- setCursor -->

<a name="select" id="select">

<h2>Link Selection Commands</h2>

<p>
As explained under <a href="#display">display()</a> above, the
pager keeps track of the current active link by the "active_link" variable in
the "page" struct. (-1 means no link is active.)
</p>

<p>
All link selection commands are implemented using a generic link search
function to find out which link to activate, and then just activating it with
<a href="hacking-links.html#activateLink">activate_link()</a> (see
hacking-links.*).
</p>

<a name="findLink" id="findLink">

<h3>find_link()</h3>

<p>
Finding the link to activate is done with the find_link() function. This
function is flexible enough to implement almost all link selection commands
with only one invocation.
</p>

<p>
find_link() looks for the first link or the last link (depending on
"match_type") inside a desired range.
</p>

<p>
The search area is primarily specified by the coordinates "start_x", "start_y"
and "end_x", "end_y", enclosing a part of the page inside which the links to be
considered have to *start*. (As usual, the start coordinates give the first
allowed positin, while the end coordinates give the first invalid position.)
Note that regardless of the beginning and end positions being given by
coordinate pairs, the range is actually linear: It spanns from the start
position to the end of the line, includes (in whole) the following lines till
"end_y", and concludes with the beginning of the line "end_y" before the end
position.
</p>

<p><pre>
line zero
 
line one with &lt;zeroth link> in it
 
line two with &lt;firST LINK> IN IT      &lt;-- start_y
                  ^start_x
LINE THREE WITH &lt;SECOND LINK> IN IT
 
LINE FOUR
 
LINE FIVE WITH &lt;THIRD LInk> in it     &lt;-- end_y
                        ^end_x
line six with &lt;fourth link> in it
</pre></p>

<p>
(The second and third links are inside the area, the zeroth, first, and fourth
not.)
</p>

<p>
There is one additional parameter limiting the search area: "end_line" limits
the range where links can *end*. (As usual, it gives the first invalid line.)
This is necessary as some commands only activate links that are already inside
the screen completely.
</p>

<p>
"end_line" or "end_x" and "end_y" can be specified alternatively, or both --
only links inside both ranges will be considered.
</p>

<p>
If any of the y paramaters ("start_y", "end_y", "end_line") is given as "-1",
it is ignored, i.e. the range extends to the end beginning/end of the page. For
the x parameters, the behaviour is more complicated: "-1" actually means that
the range starts/ends *before* the beginning of the line; thus, "start_x" being
-1 means the whole "start_y" line is inside the range, but "end_x" being -1
means the whole line is *outside* the range, i.e. only links ending *before*
"end_y" are accepted. (Just as with "end_line" and other range ends.) This may
look confusing at first, but it is consistent: Giving "end_x" means that the
beginning of the "end_y" line is inside the range *additionally* to the lines
before "end_y", just as "start_x" means the beginning of the "start_x" line is
not inside. If this isn't clear, take another look at the figure above, and
imagine what happens when "start_x" and/or "start_y" are moved to the beginning
of the line.
</p>

<p>
The implemetation of find_link() is actually fairly small, though not simple.
</p>

<p>
First, two macros are defined: INSIDE_START() testing whether "link" starts
behind the beginning of the range (i.e. whether "start_x" and "start_y" are
fulfilled), and INSIDE_END(), which tests the end of the area -- both the end
of the link start range ("end_x" and "end_y") and the link end ("end_line").
</p>

<p>
The first step is finding the candidate link -- when "match_type" is
FIND_FIRST, this is the first link starting after the beginning of the range,
and with FIND_LAST the last link before the end of the range.
</p>

<p>
The candidate located using a binary search. (Note that "first" and "last" are
really only helper variables for the search, just like "mid". The fact that,
depending on "match_type", one of those is actually the result, is only a side
effect of the search algorithm; but the respective other one is only garbage.
You should *not* confuse them for always being the first and last link inside
the area -- only one of the bounds is checked in this search!)
</p>

<p><pre>
   link0 link1              link2    link3  link4
        start =>|           ^candidate
</pre></p>

<p>
Now we test whether the candidate is actually a valid link (inside the link
number range), i.e. there are *any* links inside the boundary.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the other boundary has to be tested.
</p>

<p><pre>
   link0 link1              link2    link3  link4
              =>|           ^              |&lt;= end
                            |------------->|
                                  candidate &lt; end => OK
</pre></p>

<p>
(If there are no links inside the range, still a candidate matching the first
bound may have been found.)
</p>

<p><pre>
   link0 link1              link2    link3  link4
              =>|     |&lt;=   ^
                      |&lt;----|
                         candidate > end => nothing in range
</pre></p>

<p>
If no link matching the criteria was found, find_link() returns -1.
</p>

</a>    <!-- findLink -->

<h3>active_start() and active_end()</h3>

<p>
Cheking whether a link is (or would be) inside the valid screen area for active
links, primarily during link selection but also in a few other places, is done
using the active_start() and active_end() functions. These simply return the
bounds of the valid area (in page coordinates, not screen coordinates!).
</p>

<p>
Normally, the area starts in the line that shows up at the screen top (i.e.
"pager_pos") plus "cfg.link_margin" -- this is one line below the screen top
with the default setting. The end is the last line on screen minus the link
margin, accordingly. (But note that active_end returns the number of the *first
invalid* line, i.e. *after* the end of the valid area, as all end coordinates
are specfied this way!)
</p>

<p>
An exception is the pager being at the top (for active_start()) or bottom (for
active_end()) of the page -- in this case the valid area includes the first or
last page lines, as these can never move into the normal valid area. (The page
top can't ever move below the screen top; same for bottom.)
</p>

<p>
The "pos" parameter allows specifying some other pager position (relative to
the current "page->pager_pos") to check; 0 means using the current position.
</p>

<h3>Command Implementations</h3>

<p>
Thanks to the powerful <a href="#findLink">find_link()</a>
function, the commands are actually very simple. Most commands just consist of
one call to find_link() to find the new link, and a call to
<a href="hacking-links.html#activateLink">activate_link()</a> with
the new link number to activate it.
</p>

<p>
The simplest commands are those independant of the current cursor position.
('H', 'L', 'M') These just pass a range of line numbers (aquired with
active_start() and active_end()) to find_link().
</p>

<p>
Many commands however search forward or backward starting from the current
cursor position. These just pass the cursor position as the start (for those
searching forward) or the end of the search range, respectively. There is one
little complication when searching forward: If a link is active already
(implying the cursor is at the link start), a search starting with the cursor
position will always give the active link again. Thus, "x_start" needs to be
incremented by one in this case.
</p>

<p>
The other end of the range depends on how far the specific command searches:
Some (&lt;tab>, 'p') search till the end of the document, while others ('J', 'K',
and also '+' and '-') only to the end of the active screen area, optionally
with scrolling one line.
</p>

<p>
The latter also have to test whether a link was actually found in the desired
area, and just scroll one line with
<a href="#scrollTo">scroll_to()</a> otherwise.
</p>

<p>
Some commands ('+', '-', '^', ' and '0') do not directly search from the
cursor position, but in a range relative to the cursor line. Those are very
similar. Two of them are more complicated however:
</p>

<p>
'-' is complicated, because it has to find the first link in some range (the
previous line having any links), but the beginning of that range isn't fixed --
there might be already links in the previous line, but we might also have to go
a few lines back. Before we can search for the desired link, we have to find
out the line where to search. This is done with another invocation of
find_link(), looking for the last link starting before the current line; as
this link is obviously in the previous line having links, we can use this
link's starting line as the beginning of our search range.
</p>

<p><pre>
a line with the &lt;first link>
 
a line with the &lt;second link> and the &lt;third link>       &lt;-- start_y=new_link->y_start
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~goal     ^^^^^^^^^^^^new_link (helper)
a line with no links
 
another line with no links
 
a line with the &lt;fourth link>                            &lt;-- page->cursor_y
        ^cursor position
another line
</pre></p>

<p>
'0' is complicated, because -- opposite to all other commands -- it has to find
a link *ending* in or after some given line. find_link() has no provision for
that; extending it in this way just for this single command would be stupid.
</p>

<p>
Thus, we have to use a trick: We first search for the last link ending *before*
the current line (so we can use the existing "end_line" parameter), and then
just look for the next link -- which is obviosly the first one ending in or
after the current line.
</p>

</a>    <!-- select -->

<h2>History Commands</h2>

<p>
The history commands all work alike:
</p>

<p>
'b' goes back to the previous page by setting the current position in the
history one backwards (decrementing). The page is then (re)loaded by quitting
the pager with "RET_HISTORY" -- main() then invokes the necessary actions for
loading the page, before restarting display().
(<a href="hacking-page.html#loadPage">load_page()</a> and
<a href="hacking-load.html#initLoad">init_load()</a> take care for
correct loading of pages from history.)
</p>

<p>
'f' goes forward in the same manner (incrementing "pos").
</p>

<p>
'B' searches the history backwards, until it finds some page that is followed
either by one with the "absolute" flag set or by an internal page (the internal
page is treated like a new site). If nothing is found the search stops at the
first entry in the history, and that one is taken.
</p>

<p>
'F' searches forwards, also looking for a page followed by an absoulte URL. The
last entry is taken if nothing was found.
</p>

<p>
'^r' causes the current page to be reloaded, by returning RET_HISTORY, but not
changing the position in the page list. Thus it is not really a history command
from the user's point of view -- but technically, it is.
</p>

<p>
'r' searches backwards for a page with "mark" set. It also takes the first page
if nothing was found; 'R' does the same forwards.
</p>

<p>
The marks are set by the 's' command. This one simply sets the "mark" flag of
the current "page" structure.
</p>

<h2>Link Following</h2>

<p>
When a link is followed by typing &lt;return>, "RET_LINK" is returned, and the
main program follows the current "active_link". This process is described under
<a href="hacking-links.html#followLink">main()</a> in
hacking-links.*.
</p>

<h2>URL commands</h2>

<p>
The 'u' command causes display() to return "RET_LINK_URL"; main() then shows
the URL of the currently active link.
</p>

<p>
'c' returns "RET_URL", and main() shows the current page URL.
</p>

<p>
'U' returns "RET_ABSOLUTE_URL", causing main() to print the absolute link
target URL which is used when the link is actually followed.
</p>

<h2>Other Commands</h2>

<p>
When 'q' is typed the pager simply returns with "RET_QUIT", indicating that the
main program should quit also.
</p>

<p>
When ':' is typed the pager quits too, but returns "RET_COMMAND"; this means
that the main program should enter command mode.
</p>

<p>
'/' is very similar: "pager_ret" is set to "RET_SEARCH"; additionally,
"search.type" is set to "SEARCH_FORWARD".
