§  keystrokes table
§>==================<

[This file explains the usage of the netrik interactive UI. See index.txt or
$$<a href="index.html">$$index.html$$</a>$$ for an overview of available netrik
documentation.]

Note: netrik is still in early developement state; keystrokes and commands are
subject to changes.

$=$$<h2>$$$_Introduction$_$$</h2>$$

netrik's user interface works just like the editor "vi", and some other common
programs (e.g. "less").

There are a couple of operation modes, each one with distinct behaviour; these
modes can be switched upon need.

The mode entered when starting netrik, and used most of the time, is "normal
mode". In this mode you can move around the page, select links, etc. using
various command letters, and sometimes alternatively the cursor, <PgUp>/<PgDn>
and other keys. (The former have the advantage that you needn't take your hands
off the normal typing position.) The typed letters do not show up anywhere in
this mode; they only tell netrik to do some special action -- just like the
cursor keys.

By typing ':' in normal mode, another mode is entered, named "command prompt".
This is indicated by a ':' showing up at the beginning of the bottom screen
line, and the cursor standing just behind this ':'. You can type in a command
here. The command is executed as soon as you type <return>, and netrik returns
to normal mode afterwards.

If compiled using the GNU Readline library (default), you can use all the handy
keystrokes for editing the command prompt that are also available in other
programs using Readline. (e.g. the standard GNU/Linux shell "bash".)

$=$$<h2>$$$_Command promt$_$$</h2>$$

Only one command is available for now (in two variations):

$§$$<strong>$$:e URL     $$</strong>$$load file "URL" and display it in the pager
$§           (URL relative to current page)
$§
$§$$<strong>$$:E URL     $$</strong>$$load file "URL" and display it in the pager
$§           (absolute URL)

$=$$<h2>$$$_Text Search$_$$</h2>$$

Pressing '/' in normal mode opens the search prompt. This is similar to the
command prompt (s.a.), only you are not prompted for a command, but for a
search string. Type in what you want to search for, and confirm with <return>.

If you have already done a search in this session, you can search again for the
same string by only pressing <return> without entering any string.

Use '^D' on an empty search prompt to abort the prompt and return to the pager.
(If you have already typed some string you first need to delete it, using '^U'
for example.)

$=$$<h2>$$$_Signals$_$$</h2>$$

Netrik intercepts the interrupt signal (SIGINT, usually produced by ^C ), and
uses it to allow aborting a file or HTTP load. In other situations, it is
ignored completely.

Use the quit signal (SIGQUIT, usually ^\ ) to "violently" quit netrik. (This
has the same effect as an unintercepted ^C.)
