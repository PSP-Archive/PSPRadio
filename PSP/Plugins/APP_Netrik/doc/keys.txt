  keystrokes table
>==================<

[This file explains the usage of the netrik interactive UI. See index.txt or
index.html for an overview of available netrik documentation.]

Note: netrik is still in early developement state; keystrokes and commands
are subject to changes.

_Introduction_

netrik's user interface works just like the editor "vi", and some other common
programs (e.g. "less").

There are a couple of operation modes, each one with distinct behaviour;
these modes can be switched upon need.

The mode entered when starting netrik, and used most of the time, is "normal
mode". In this mode you can move around the page, select links, etc. using
various command letters, and sometimes alternatively the cursor, <PgUp>/<PgDn>
and other keys. (The former have the advantage that you needn't take your
hands off the normal typing position.) The typed letters do not show up
anywhere in this mode; they only tell netrik to do some special action --
just like the cursor keys.

By typing ':' in normal mode, another mode is entered, named "command prompt".
This is indicated by a ':' showing up at the beginning of the bottom screen
line, and the cursor standing just behind this ':'. You can type in a command
here. The command is executed as soon as you type <return>, and netrik returns
to normal mode afterwards.

If compiled using the GNU Readline library (default), you can use all the
handy keystrokes for editing the command prompt that are also available in
other programs using Readline. (e.g. the standard GNU/Linux shell "bash".)

_Keystrokes in normal mode_

 ^R        reload current page
 
 b         
 <left>    back to previous page in history
 
 f         
 <right>   forward to next page in history (after 'b')
 
 B         back to page before last absolute URL entered/followed
           (previous site)
 
 F         forward to page before next absolute URL entered/followed
 
 s         set page mark
 
 S         remove page mark
 
 r         return to previous page in history marked with 's'
 
 R         forward to next page in history marked with 's'
 
 ^H        cursor left
 
 ^J        cursor down
 
 ^K        cursor up
 
 ^L        cursor right
 
 j         scroll one line forward
 
 J         
 <down>    go to next link, or scroll one line forward
           (if no more links on screen)
 
 k         scroll one line backward
 
 K         
 <up>      go to previous link, or scroll one line backward
           (if no more links on screen)
 
 +         
 =         go to first link in next line, or scroll one line forward
           (if no more links on screen)
 
 -         go to first link in previous line, or scroll one line backward
           (if no more links on screen)
 
 ^         
 ^A        go to first link starting in line
 
 -         go to first link in line
           (different from '^' if there is a link wrapped from previous line)
 
          
 ^E        go to last link in line
 
 H         go to first link on screen
 
 L         go to last link on screen
 
 M         go to midmost link (first link in second screen half)
 
 <tab>     go to next link
 
 p         go to previous link
 
 <bs>      go to first link on page
 
 u         show link URL
 
 U         show absolute link target URL
 
 c         show current page URL
 
 <return>  follow selected link (or manipulate form control)
 
 <del>     scroll two lines forward
 
 <ins>     scroll two lines backward
 
 ^F        
 <space>   scroll one screen forward
 
 ^B        scroll one screen backward
 
 ^D        
 <PgDn>    scroll one half screen forward
 
 ^U        
 <PgUp>    scroll one half screen backward
 
 g         
 <Home>    go to page top
 
 G         
 <End>     go to page end
 
 q         quit netrik
 
 /         start text search (s.b.)
 
 :         enter command prompt (s.b.)

_Command promt_

Only one command is available for now (in two variations):

:e URL     load file "URL" and display it in the pager
           (URL relative to current page)
 
:E URL     load file "URL" and display it in the pager
           (absolute URL)

_Text Search_

Pressing '/' in normal mode opens the search prompt. This is similar to the
command prompt (s.a.), only you are not prompted for a command, but for a
search string. Type in what you want to search for, and confirm with <return>.

If you have already done a search in this session, you can search again for
the same string by only pressing <return> without entering any string.

Use '^D' on an empty search prompt to abort the prompt and return to the pager.
(If you have already typed some string you first need to delete it, using
'^U' for example.)

_Signals_

Netrik intercepts the interrupt signal (SIGINT, usually produced by ^C ),
and uses it to allow aborting a file or HTTP load. In other situations,
it is ignored completely.

Use the quit signal (SIGQUIT, usually ^\ ) to "violently" quit netrik. (This
has the same effect as an unintercepted ^C.)
