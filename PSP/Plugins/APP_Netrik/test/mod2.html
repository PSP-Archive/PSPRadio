   <pre>
the first link is no longer here; the <a href="url2">second link</a> however has kept it's place (except for the column)
<a href="url3">another link</a> is still here
-
-
-
-
-
the amount of free space has extended considerably
-
-
-
-
-
the fourth link has a <a href="url4">changed name</a>, while the <a href="wrong1">fifth</a> has a different URL
(besides of the somewhat moved positions and link numbers)
-
now there is less free space here, so the rest of the file stays in the same place
<a href="url1">the first link</a> is now here
-
a <a href="wrong2">completely different link</a> in place of the lonely one, but with exactly the same position and link number
-
many of the following links are resembling the <a href="url13">thirteenth</a> link, but none of them really matches:
the above one is actually correct, except it is too far away (both position and link number)
-
-
-
-
-
the seventh and eighth links are gone
the <a href="url9">nineth</a> is not perfect, but better then the clone below
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
<a href="url13">the tenth link</a> has the right URL, but is too far away;
the eleventh is named <a href="url11">thirteenth</a>, but has a wrong URL, and is also too far away to be considered anyways;
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
here is an additional link which might be taken as the <a href="url9">nineth</a> link, if there wasn't a better match above

still lots of free space here

the <a href="url12">twelfth</a> link is mostly intact and serves as a dummy;
a <a href="wrong4">different</a> link with the link number of thirteen is almost in the right place, but not exactly
the last link and the free space are gone, to make sure the similar links above are actually far away (relatively)
