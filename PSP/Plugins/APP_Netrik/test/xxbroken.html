   <h1> heading </h1>
   <p>
      first paragraph of text with an invented end tag
      </h1>
   <p>
      second paragraph contains wrongly nested <em>emphasized and <strong>strong</em> text</strong>,
      and some broken escape sequences and tags: & &&; &amp ;&?!someting; &what? < <= <<<br>
      followed by more text
   <p "id=broken" title=broken tag">
      third paragraph with many illegal characters  <hr"!?//> in it
   <p>
      and finally a very broken tag, that causes the rest of the file to be misinterpreted:
      <hr id="wronglyQuoted>
      rest of file
</body>
