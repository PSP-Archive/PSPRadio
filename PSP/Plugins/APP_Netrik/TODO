The ASAP section lists features that we consider quite important and which are
not too hard to implement, without any major changes to the program structure.
These things may be implemented in some of the 1.x releases, but may also be
moved to 2.x or some later point if the 2.0 branch starts before they are
implemented.

The 2.x section shows the things that we will probably go into when starting
the next unstable branch.

The future section aggregates all features which we have a mind to implement in
the mid-near feature, but don't know in which version yet. (Probably after 2.x)

The "nice to have" section lists suggestions and ideas that we consider useful,
but do not have any concrete plans to implement any time soon. Of course,
volunteers for those are welcome.

Versions 2.x and later are open for anything you can think of :-) (See
http://netrik.sf.net/dev.html for ideas...)

The parenthesis give information about the difficulty level of each task. If
you are interested in working on some of these, please subscribe to the mailing
list (see _Keeping in Touch_ in README), and tell us what you want to do.

As soon as possible, but no specific target version:
- better website

- improved command line handling (fairly easy, very little knowledge necessary)
- introductory helpfile
- improved keyboard handling (medium, little knowledge)
- open helpfile (docs overview) with special command in pager (probably fairly
  easy, little or medium knowledge)
- cookies (fairly easy, some knowledge of loading module)
- file download (medium, good knowledge of loading module)
- display plain text files (fairly simple, good knowledge of layouting)
- mailcap handling (medium, some(?) knowledge of loading module)
- monochrome display support (medium, some knowledge of a few parts of
  layouting and pager)
- add missing character entity references (&foo;) (very easy, no knowledge of
  netrik code)

Planned for 2.x:
- new syntax parser (very complicated, very good knowledge of layouting module)

x.x:
- special --debug-html mode to help finding errors in HTML code

Nice to have:
- tabbed browsing (complicated, good knowledge)
